# Make a Note, Take a Note

**A social experiment in anonymous community building.**

For a class assignment to create a product for public good --- with the
constraint of presenting it only through a small gallery stand --- my
partner and I decided to make the stand itself the product. The result
was **Make a Note, Take a Note**: a simple, interactive installation
designed to foster connection among strangers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How It Works

Passersby were invited to:\
1. **Write a note** --- a brief, personal message to an unknown future
reader.\
2. **Categorize it** --- place the note into a pocket labeled by theme
(hope, humor, advice, gratitude, etc.).\
3. **Take a note** --- retrieve a message left by someone else in the
same category.

This exchange created a cycle of anonymous but intimate interaction,
where gifts of thought, encouragement, or reflection moved silently from
one person to another.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results

The experiment was an **astounding success**:\
- By the end of the testing week, the stack of notes and envelopes had
been completely depleted.\
- Participants commented on both the **craftsmanship and visual appeal**
of the prototype, which drew them in.\
- The only challenge arose when multiple notes were placed in the same
pocket, leading to minor confusion --- highlighting the need for clearer
labels and instructions in future iterations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prototyping Process

-   **Brainstorming**: Explored ways to encourage anonymous but
    meaningful interaction.\
-   **Sketching**: Designed an approachable, stand-based interface with
    labeled categories.\
-   **Building**: Crafted the final prototype, balancing aesthetic
    appeal with functional organization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Impact

*Make a Note, Take a Note* demonstrated how even the smallest
interventions can spark genuine moments of connection. By transforming a
simple stand into a platform for sharing, the project showed that
**community can be built one note at a time.**
