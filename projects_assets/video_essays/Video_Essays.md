# Video Essays

**Exploring storytelling through moving image and sound.**

As part of a course centered on the **art of the video essay**, I
explored how narrative, visuals, and audio can combine to create
compelling forms of storytelling. Over the span of the class, I produced
**three distinct video essays**, each different in subject matter, tone,
and creative approach.

-   **Video Essay 1**: A personal reflection on the motivations behind
    my visual arts practice, blending voiceover with imagery to connect
    process and purpose.\
-   **Video Essay 2**: A critical commentary on the **overuse and
    overstimulation of screens** in modern life, examining how advancing
    technology reshapes attention, habits, and well-being. *(This video
    is featured here.)*\
-   **Video Essay 3**: An investigative piece on the rise of **deepfake
    technology**, highlighting its potential dangers not only for public
    figures, but also for everyday individuals navigating issues of
    trust, privacy, and digital identity.

Each project allowed me to experiment with **visual rhythm, editing
techniques, and audio design**, while sharpening my skills in
research-based storytelling. This collection of essays demonstrates my
ability to move fluidly between **personal narrative, cultural critique,
and technological commentary** --- all through the medium of video.
