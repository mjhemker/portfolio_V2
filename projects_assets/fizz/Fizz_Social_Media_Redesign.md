# Fizz Social Media Redesign

**Reimagining the student social network for growth and new
opportunities.**

Fizz is a rapidly growing, student-focused social platform used in over
**180 universities nationwide**. For this project, I set out to redesign
Fizz's **user interface, color palette, and overall experience** while
also proposing new features that could expand its value to students.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem

While popular, Fizz's UI felt inconsistent and limited in scope. The
existing design lacked a strong visual identity, and its feature set was
focused narrowly on casual posting. Students looking for project
collaborators or job opportunities had no dedicated space, leaving those
needs unmet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Process

I began by replicating the current Fizz UI to create a foundation for
redesign. From there, I:\
- Developed a **universal color palette** to unify branding and improve
readability.\
- Explored **dramatic color usage, bold layouts, and restructured
post/comment relationships** to make the interface more engaging and
easier to navigate.\
- Designed prototypes for two **new feature concepts**:\
- **Project Tags** -- Custom tags to help students promote or join
campus projects.\
- **Job Section** -- A dedicated post type and feed for campus and local
job opportunities.

Throughout the process, I balanced **visual experimentation** with
**functional expansion**, ensuring that new ideas aligned with the
student community's needs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Solution

The final redesign delivered both a **visual refresh** and **new
functionality**:\
- A cohesive **color palette** and cleaner interface for a stronger
brand presence.\
- A redesigned **post/comment flow** with simplified hierarchies and
clearer interactions.\
- Fully realized **Jobs and Projects features**, offering students
practical tools to advance their studies, careers, and collaborations.

By combining a modernized UI with new features, this redesign
demonstrates how Fizz could evolve from a **niche social app into a
central hub for student life** --- connecting not only conversations,
but also opportunities.
