# The Periphery Podcast

## Logo & Cover Art Rebrand

**Designing a new identity for a nationally recognized podcast.**

I was commissioned to rebrand **The Periphery Podcast**, which at the
time ranked among the **Top 200 podcasts in the U.S.** and was a leading
voice in the **law and finance genre**. The challenge was to create a
visual identity that matched the podcast's reputation for thoughtful,
balanced storytelling while also feeling bold and modern enough to stand
out in a crowded digital space.

## Logo Design

The logo symbolizes the podcast's role as a **mediator between
perspectives**. Two opposing sides converge in the center, connected
through the podcast itself --- the "middle-man" that bridges speakers
and listeners, law and finance, story and interpretation. The clean,
geometric design reflects clarity and professionalism, while the
symmetry communicates balance and fairness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cover Art

The redesigned cover art builds on themes of **accessibility and
broadcast**, nodding to the early days of radio as a metaphor for
bringing news directly to the people. The composition is simple yet
powerful, designed to be instantly recognizable across podcast platforms
while conveying trust, authority, and approachability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Outcome

Together, the logo and cover art provided **The Periphery Podcast** with
a **cohesive new identity** that elevated its presence among top-tier
shows. The rebrand communicates its mission clearly: to connect complex
issues with everyday listeners, bridging the gap between expertise and
audience.
