# PocketPeople

**Because remembering the little things is what makes relationships
matter.**

We all want to be great friends, partners, and family members --- but
life (and our memory) doesn't always cooperate. I often found myself
forgetting birthdays, favorite movies, or even how many pets a friend
has. Not because I don't care, but because it's hard to keep track of
everything. **PocketPeople** was born out of that frustration: a fun,
personal app that helps you keep all the important details about the
people you love in one dedicated place.

PocketPeople works like a digital deck of cards for your relationships.
Each person gets their own customizable profile, where you can add
notes, favorite things, important dates, and more. From there, you can
set reminders, sort your most important people into favorites, and even
play memory games to test yourself on the details you've stored.

## Why It Matters

-   Being thoughtful shouldn't depend on having a perfect memory.\
-   Relationships thrive when you remember the details that make people
    feel seen.\
-   Most apps focus on productivity or networking --- PocketPeople is
    built purely for personal connection.

## Features

-   **Custom Cards** -- Create personalized cards for each person, with
    editable details that grow over time.\
-   **Reminders** -- Never miss a birthday, anniversary, or big event
    again.\
-   **Favorites** -- Pin your closest connections for quick access.\
-   **Memory Games** -- Test yourself on friends' facts in a playful way
    that makes remembering effortless.

## How It's Made

PocketPeople was developed using **Cursor, Expo, and React Native**,
styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, modern interface. I designed
the layout and flow in **Figma** before coding the final product. The
playful **32-bit stickers** were created with AI and hand-touched for
polish.

Currently, PocketPeople is awaiting **App Store verification** and will
soon be available for download.
