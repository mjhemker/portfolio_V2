# Pantreat

**Your all-in-one AI-Kitchen assistant that makes cooking cool again.**\
Unlike other kitchen aids (meal services or smart fridges that cost a
fortune), all you need is your **phone and an appetite.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background

I grew up in a household where cooking was not just a task, but a way to
bring people together --- a way to prioritize health as well as the
wallet. Sadly, this isn't the case for many younger generations today.
Recipes are no longer passed down, and people spend more time in front
of a screen than a stove.

Society has set the narrative that *"Gen Z Can't Cook."*\
- Gen Z doesn't want to spend 30 minutes watching a TV cooking show.\
- Home Ec classes no longer exist.\
- And flipping through cookbooks? Forget it.

But what Gen Z **is** good at is learning from each other. On social
media, young people teach each other about nutrition, weight training,
art, and more. Pantreat taps into this habit, giving Gen Z a platform to
do what they do best --- influence and inspire one another. Pantreat
aims to reduce reliance on food delivery and jumpstart the revival of
the **at-home chef.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Need Finding

I interviewed \~30 students, parents, and young adults from **Baltimore
City** and **Stanford**. Results were surprisingly consistent:
**everyone needs help in the kitchen.**

The three biggest struggles were:\
1. **Organization**\
2. **Anxiety**\
3. **Lack of Excitement / Discovery**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How Pantreat Helps

### 1. Organization

Cooking is hard --- and cooking consistently is even harder. Plans
change, value packs pile up, and suddenly you're staring at a fridge
full of half-used produce and forgotten sauces. On average, Americans
throw away **20% of their groceries.**

Pantreat tackles this by:\
- Helping you make meals with what you already have.\
- Keeping you accountable and organized with reminders for expiration
dates.\
- Suggesting daily, personalized meals based on your schedule and
dietary preferences.

**Result:** More good food on the table, and extra cash in your pocket.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Anxiety

People want to cook --- they know the benefits --- but friction and lack
of confidence hold them back.

Pantreat's **Cook Mode** acts as your custom **AI-sous chef**, walking
you through recipes step-by-step with:\
- Built-in timers\
- Voice responses\
- Smart substitutions

This helps beginners gain confidence while encouraging consistency. To
keep motivation high, users can share creations with friends for **group
accountability** --- think *Strava, but for cooking.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Excitement & Discovery

Motivation alone isn't enough. Cooking needs excitement. That's where
Pantreat's **Feed** comes in.

The feed features **short-form cooking videos** from:\
- Friends\
- Influencers\
- Creators\
- Other users

Unlike Instagram or TikTok, every video has an attached **recipe and
auto-adjusting grocery list.** With Instacart's API, you can order
ingredients instantly and have them delivered within the hour --- making
it easy to *literally cook what you see.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Business Model

Pantreat is sticky because it integrates into **daily routines**,
creating multiple natural revenue streams:

-   **Grocery Affiliate Partnerships** (Instacart, Amazon, Walmart)
    -   U.S. Grocery Market Sales (2025): **\$1.6 trillion** (+3.1% YoY
        growth)\
    -   Online U.S. Grocery Sales (May 2025): **\$8.7 billion** (+27%
        YoY)\
-   **Advertisements & Algorithmic Product Suggestions**\
-   **Long-Term:** Data-driven personalization for health/fitness
    integrations and observing food trends/habits

**Creator Incentive:** Whenever a user orders groceries linked to a
creator's recipe video, that creator gets a cut --- encouraging more
content and engagement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

Pantreat combines **AI, community, and short-form content** to remove
the friction of cooking, reduce waste, and make the kitchen exciting
again. With tools to organize, motivate, and inspire, Pantreat empowers
a new generation to step away from delivery apps and rediscover the joy
of home cooking.
