# Vinnie Hager Rugs

## Allied Apartments --- Rug & Wall Installation

**Custom large-scale designs for communal lounge spaces.**

I collaborated with **Timothy Prieto** and **Nathalie Beatty** to design
custom rug and wall pieces for the **8th Floor Lounges** of the
to-be-built **Allied Apartments in Harbor Point, Baltimore**.

The designs are heavily influenced by the **doodle-like work of artist
Vinnie Hager**, scaled up to fit architectural proportions. The **color
palette** was carefully selected to align with the apartment's diverse
interior themes, ensuring each piece complements the building's overall
aesthetic.

-   **Rug Design**: A **28' x 18' floor rug**, rendered in AutoCAD. A
    **2' x 3' "strike-off" sample** was produced by **Kebabian's Rugs**
    to test color and material accuracy prior to full manufacturing.\
-   **Wall Piece**: An **18' x 14' decorative installation**, also
    rendered in AutoCAD, designed as a bold focal point for the lounge
    space.

Together, these pieces serve as **vibrant, site-specific artworks** that
bring energy and identity to the Allied Apartments' communal areas. They
function not just as d√©cor, but as **statement installations** that set
the tone for the building's shared environment.
